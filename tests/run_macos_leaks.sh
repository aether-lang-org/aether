# tests/run_macos_leaks.sh — macOS leaks(1) gate for the memory-
# ownership regression suite (#468).
#
# Why this exists: macOS has no working leak sanitizer. Apple's
# bundled clang ships ASan WITHOUT LeakSanitizer, and upstream LLVM's
# LSan hangs on Apple Silicon (sanitizers#1026, LLVM discourse 73148).
# Linux CI gets leak coverage from Valgrind (`make test-valgrind`) and
# ASan-with-LSan; macOS got nothing — which is exactly how the #471
# CI failures slipped past local macOS runs. Apple's `leaks(1)` tool
# is the one detector that works here: it inspects the heap at exit
# with no rebuild and no sanitizer flag.
#
# Scope: the FULL tests/regression suite. Every regression program is
# built with `ae build` (release -O2) and run under
# `MallocStackLogging=1 leaks --atExit`; a non-zero leak count fails the
# gate. Two audited side-lists qualify this:
#
#   tests/leaks_known.txt    — per-test MAX allowed leak count (third-
#                              party library process-globals + tracked
#                              known leaks). A test absent here must
#                              report 0; a test present may report up to
#                              its cap. Exceeding the cap fails.
#   tests/leaks_exclude.txt  — programs leaks(1) cannot run (they fork
#                              child processes; leaks --atExit hangs).
#                              Leak-checked on Linux CI instead.
#
# MallocStackLogging adds ~10x runtime, so the full sweep is slower than
# the old curated subset — but it is the only way a new leak in an
# un-curated program fails locally rather than slipping to CI.
#
# Skips cleanly (exit 0) on non-Darwin hosts.

# NOTE: deliberately no `set -e`. Every build / leaks invocation has its
# exit code captured and handled explicitly below, and leaks(1) itself
# exits non-zero whenever it reports leaks — including the audited
# allowed counts in leaks_known.txt — so `set -e` would abort the whole
# gate on the first allowed leak.
