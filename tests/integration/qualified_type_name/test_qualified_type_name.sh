# Issue #946: a module-qualified type name `mod.Type` was accepted as a
# value/call (`lib.mk(...)`, #878) but NOT in a TYPE position — the parser
# stopped at the `.` with `Expected RIGHT_PAREN, got DOT` (param) /
# `Expected LEFT_BRACE, got DOT` (return). The bare exported name worked, so
# the qualifier — the disambiguator for two imports exporting the same type
# name — had no parseable spelling.
#
# Fixed in the type parser (qualified name in parse_type) plus the return-type
# disambiguator and the C-style-typed-local dispatcher. `mod.Type` resolves to
# the bare exported type (the merge brings it into the consumer unprefixed).
#
# Fixture (lib/lib.ae): struct Box + mk(). main.ae uses `lib.Box` as a
# parameter type, a return type, and a C-style typed local.
#
# Acceptance: compiles, runs, prints "6 7".
