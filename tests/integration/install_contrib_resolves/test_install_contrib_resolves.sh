# Issue #334 regression: `make install` populates share/aether/contrib/
# with each contrib module's module.ae descriptor + headers, so an
# Aether program can `import contrib.<X>` and have the resolver find
# the descriptor without needing the upstream aether checkout living
# at a known relative path.
#
# Verifies:
#   1. install.sh writes contrib/<X>/module.ae for every module that
#      had one in the source tree.
#   2. install.sh trims the source-tree noise (.c, .m, tests/,
#      benchmarks/, example_*.ae, test_*.sh, build.sh, ci.sh) — the
#      install layout is descriptor-+-header only, with one
#      explicit carve-out: contrib/host/<lang>/aether_host_<lang>.c
#      DOES ship (plain `make install` doesn't build the matching
#      libaether_host_<lang>.a, so downstream apps that
#      `import contrib.host.<lang>` compile the bridge from source).
#      See docs/install-layout.md "What does NOT ship".
#   3. The module.ae files are syntactically what the resolver looks
#      for: a non-empty file at the documented path.

# Second install path: `make install-contrib`. This is the separate
# installer that ships the prebuilt libaether_<X>.a archives alongside
# each module's source tree. It uses a DIFFERENT trim policy from
# install.sh (above) — historically the two diverged (Makefile trimmed
# tinyweb/ while install.sh shipped it). Pin both shapes so they don't
# drift apart again.
#
# Compared to install.sh's check: this path additionally requires the
# libaether_<X>.a archive present under lib/aether/ for each module
# that contrib_build.sh built. We don't require every module to have a
# .a (system dep absence → SKIP, not FAIL), but the canaries listed
# above MUST ship both module.ae AND the matching archive.
#
# Windows skip: `make install-contrib` shells `contrib_build.sh` which
# probes for sqlite3/python/lua/perl/ruby/duktape/tcl dev libs — none
# are available under MSYS2/MinGW on the GitHub runner, and the suite
# is already 4x slower on Windows (~33 min vs ~8 min on Linux). The
# install.sh half above provides the layout coverage; the
# make install-contrib half runs on every Linux/macOS lane and that
# is sufficient. Skip with a [SKIP-WIN] marker so the .ae-test runner
# (Makefile:542) records the skip as a pass with a reason.
