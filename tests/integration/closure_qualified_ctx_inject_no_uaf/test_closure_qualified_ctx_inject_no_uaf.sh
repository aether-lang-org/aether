# Regression Part 3 for closure-env-freed-when-passed-to-extern-callee.
#
# Shape under test: same as Part 2 (cross-module visible-body wrapper
# with `_ctx: ptr`, _ctx-injection at the call site, closure-captures-
# closure payload) BUT invoked through a whole-module import using
# qualified call syntax (`uikit.register_btn(...)`). This is the form
# aether-ui uses (`import aether_ui` + `aether_ui.btn(...)`).
#
# Pre-Part-3-fix, the drain-gate's _ctx-injection arg→param shift
# looked the callee up in the merged program AST using the RAW
# qualified value (e.g. "uikit.register_btn"). The merged AST stores
# cross-module functions under their normalised (dot→underscore)
# name ("uikit_register_btn"), so the lookup missed, the shift was
# skipped, and the escape walk asked about `label` instead of
# `on_press` → false-non-escape → UAF (exactly aether-ui's
# example_testable.ae `+1` button).
#
# Part 2's selective-import test (closure_builder_ctx_inject_no_uaf)
# passed without this fix because selective imports lower the call
# site to a bare unqualified name, bypassing the missed normalisation.
# This test exists to lock in the qualified-call path.
#
# We run under ASan; pass means no `_ad_X.env` free is emitted and
# the C-side invocation succeeds cleanly.
