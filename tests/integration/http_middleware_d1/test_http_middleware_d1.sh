# #260 Tier 1 / Phase D1: 4 middleware end-to-end.
#
# Verifies each middleware in turn against the running server:
#   - vhost  : Host: foo.example -> 404 "Unknown host"
#   - auth   : missing Authorization -> 401 with WWW-Authenticate
#              wrong credentials -> 401
#              correct credentials (alice:secret) -> 200
#   - cors   : OPTIONS preflight -> 204 with Access-Control headers
#              GET response carries the configured headers
#   - rate   : 11th request inside the 5s window -> 429 with
#              Retry-After
#
# Skips when curl(1) is missing.

# Skip on Windows — the HTTP server / proxy / middleware code path
# under test is platform-independent userland C; the Linux and
# macOS CI matrix entries already exercise every behaviour this
# test asserts. Each curl invocation under MSYS2 bash pays Cygwin
# fork-emulation + Defender + slower-than-POSIX localhost overhead
# (~10-100x POSIX's per-spawn cost), so running these on Windows
# adds minutes to the pipeline without adding coverage. Windows-
# specific runtime concerns (file I/O, process spawning, path
# handling) are covered by fs_*, std_ipc_*, run_lib_path, and
# ae_help tests respectively.
