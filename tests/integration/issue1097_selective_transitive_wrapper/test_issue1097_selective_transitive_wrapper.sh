# Regression for #1097: a selective `import std.tcp (connect)` in the top-level
# unit must NOT suppress instantiation of the tuple wrappers (poll2/read_n/
# write_n) that an imported library uses transitively.
#
# Before the fix the transitive cross-module merge skipped std.tcp entirely
# once it was a *direct* (selective) import, so the omitted wrappers were never
# cloned and relaylib's call sites degraded to an undefined `tcp_poll2`. A build
# with NO top-level std.tcp import already worked (std.tcp reached only
# transitively → full merge), so a partial import was wrongly *stronger* than no
# import. This test pins the "partial import" case to build.
