# Regression: `make install` / `install.sh` ship the contrib host
# bridge sources so a plain installed tree is link-suitable for
# downstream apps that `import contrib.host.<lang>`.
#
# Before this carve-out, the install ran `find contrib -name '*.c'
# -delete` which silently removed the bridge .c files alongside
# the other contrib .c sources. The .ae module descriptors and
# .h headers stayed, so the resolver was happy — but the link
# step then had no `aether_host_<lang>_*` symbols to satisfy.
#
# Plain `make install` does NOT also build/install
# `libaether_host_<lang>.a` (that's a separate opt-in step via
# `make install-contrib`, gated on the per-language dev libraries
# being present). So the only thing that makes a plain install
# link-suitable for host bridges is the source files themselves.
#
# Verifies:
#   1. install.sh ships every contrib/host/<lang>/aether_host_<lang>.c
#      that exists in the source tree.
#   2. No OTHER contrib .c file slips through (the carve-out is
#      surgical — broad `find -name '*.c'` cleanup still runs).
#   3. The companion .h header and module.ae descriptor are
#      present too (otherwise compiling the bridge would fail).
