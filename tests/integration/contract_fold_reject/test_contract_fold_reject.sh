# Contract folding (docs/contract-folding.md): a `requires` / `where` predicate
# that is decidably FALSE at compile time — at the definition, or at a call
# site with the constant arguments substituted — is a compile error, not a
# deferred runtime panic. Each reject_*.ae MUST fail to build, for the stated
# reason (a rejection for the WRONG reason would mean the fold never ran and
# something else broke).
#
# The runtime half is asserted here too: a violation the fold CANNOT decide
# (a runtime argument) must still panic at run time with the same message
# text — folding promotes diagnoses, it must never remove checks.
#
# Pruned from the generic .ae runner (these sources exist to be compiled and
# have their diagnostics inspected).
