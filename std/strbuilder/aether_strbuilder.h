/* std.strbuilder — amortised-O(1) string append primitive.
 *
 * (Module is named `strbuilder` rather than `builder` because the
 * latter is reserved in Aether for configure-then-execute DSL
 * functions. The API mirrors Java/Kotlin StringBuilder, Go's
 * strings.Builder, Rust's String::push_str.)
 *
 * The canonical accumulator idiom `out = string.concat(out, chunk)`
 * in a loop is O(N²) per byte because every concat reallocates and
 * memcpy's the full prefix. A correctly-tracked heap-string just
 * means each leak is freed promptly; the algorithmic cost stays.
 *
 * AetherStrBuilder solves that with a growing internal buffer (2×
 * doubling on overflow, amortised-O(1) per byte appended). The
 * lifecycle is:
 *
 *     b = strbuilder.new(cap_hint)
 *     strbuilder.append(b, chunk)     // any number of times
 *     out = strbuilder.finish(b)      // hand the buffer off; b invalid
 *
 * strbuilder.finish hands the accumulated bytes to a refcounted
 * AetherString and destroys the builder. The returned string is
 * heap-owned (caller frees / heap-tracker reclaims at scope exit).
 * If a caller decides mid-build to abandon the work,
 * strbuilder.free(b) discards without producing a string.
 *
 * The append surface mirrors what's needed by the avn-style
 * dir-blob, JSON / log / template / packed-record building patterns
 * — bytes, full strings, int decimals, and explicit-length strings
 * for binary-safe content (embedded NULs round-trip). */

 * is no Aether-side wrapper because a va_list cannot cross the Aether
 * boundary. It exists so that a handwritten variadic C shim (which

 * formatting to a strbuilder, then route the finished bytes back to
 * Aether — the C->Aether bridge for the *defining* side of the
 * variadic story (Aether deliberately has no defining-varargs).
 *
 * va_list consumption contract: this call CONSUMES the caller's `ap`
 * (matching the vsnprintf contract). The caller must `va_end(ap)`
 * afterwards, and must NOT pass `ap` to a second consumer. A caller
 * that needs to format the same arguments twice (e.g. a retry with a
 * fallback format) must take its own `va_copy` *before* calling:
 *
 *     va_list ap, saved;
 *     va_start(ap, fmt);

 *     va_end(ap);
 *     aether_strbuilder_vappend_format(b2, fmt, saved);  // consumes saved
 *     va_end(saved);
 *
 * Internally a va_copy is taken for the fast-path scratch probe so a
 * 256-byte-overflowing format still has a fresh va_list to re-format
 * from; that is an implementation detail and does not relax the
 * "caller's ap is consumed" contract above. Returns 1 on success, 0
 * on failure (NULL builder, NULL fmt, encoding error, OOM). */
