// Deliberately separate from the shared std.worker pool. A worker task
// runs one unit of work and returns; a connection is owned for its whole
// lifetime, and with keep-alive enabled (keep_alive_max == 0 meaning
// unlimited) that is unbounded in time. Routing connections onto the
// shared pool would let idle keep-alive clients occupy every thread in
// it and starve worker.run jobs and HTTP/2 stream dispatch, which share
// that pool. Separate lifetimes need separate thread budgets.
