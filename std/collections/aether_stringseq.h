/* std.collections.string_seq — Erlang/Elixir-shaped cons-cell linked
 * list of string values.
 *
 * Empty list is the NULL pointer. Each cell carries a CACHED length
 * field so `string_seq_length(s)` is O(1) — Erlang's BEAM doesn't
 * cache length per cell because of its fixed compact cell layout;
 * Aether controls the layout, so we do.
 *
 * Cells are reference-counted to allow structural sharing without
 * copying:
 *
 *     t  = string_seq_cons("c",  string_seq_cons("d", NULL));
 *     a  = string_seq_cons("a",  t);   // shares t
 *     b  = string_seq_cons("b",  t);   // shares t
 *     string_seq_free(a);              // a frees, t stays alive for b
 *     string_seq_free(b);              // b frees, t now drops to 0 and frees
 *
 * Cells are also IMMUTABLE after creation — `cons` is the only
 * constructor; there's no `set_head` or `set_tail`. That makes
 * cycles impossible, so the iterative free below cannot loop, and
 * we don't need cycle detection on the spine.
 *
 * Operation complexity:
 *   empty / cons / head / tail / is_empty / length / retain : O(1)
 *   free                                                    : O(n) work,
 *                                                              O(1) stack
 *                                                              (iterative)
 *   from_array                                              : O(n)
 *   to_array                                                : O(n)
 *
 * Refcount semantics:
 *   - `cons(h, t)` retains BOTH `h` (via aether_string_retain) and
 *     `t` (via string_seq_retain). Callers that want to transfer
 *     their ref into the new cell call `string_seq_free` on the old
 *     local immediately afterward — see `string_seq_from_array` for
 *     the canonical builder pattern.
 *   - `retain(s)` bumps a cell's refcount; pair with `free(s)`.
 *   - `free(s)` decrements; if it reaches zero we release the head
 *     and walk to the tail. If a tail cell is still shared
 *     (refcount > 0 after decrement) we stop — the other owner
 *     finishes the walk later when its own free runs.
 *
 * Issue: motivated by the svn-aether port hitting a `string.split()`-
 * returning-`ptr` mismatch with `string[]` message fields. Cons cells
 * give a runtime-built sequence shape that fits actor messages
 * cleanly without forcing callers to plumb a separate `count` field.

/* ---- Closure-bearing combinators ------------------------------------
 *
 * Higher-order iteration over the cons spine, taking an Aether closure
 * as the per-element callback (issue #421 — multi-sequence iteration
 * primitives). These resolve the "deferred to a follow-up change set
 * once the Aether-callback-from-C bridge is settled" note that the
 * structural combinators above carried.
 *
 * Closure ABI
 * -----------
 * Each callback parameter is declared `ptr` (C `void*`) on both sides,
 * and the Aether `extern` declares it `ptr` too. When a caller passes
 * a closure literal into a `ptr`-typed slot, the codegen heap-BOXES it:
 *
 *     extern_fn(..., _aether_box_closure(
 *         (_AeClosure){ .fn = (void(*)(void))_closure_fn_N, .env = _e }))
 *
 * where `_AeClosure` is the codegen prologue's
 *
 *     typedef struct { void (*fn)(void); void* env; } _AeClosure;
 *
 * `_aether_box_closure` malloc's a copy of that two-word struct and
 * hands us the heap pointer. We mirror the layout locally as
 * `AeSeqClosure` (see the .c — this TU need not see the prologue
 * typedef) and read `.fn` / `.env` back out. The closure body is then
 * invoked as
 *
 *     ((RET(*)(void* env, ARG1, ARG2, ...))clo.fn)(clo.env, a1, a2, ...)
 *
 * i.e. `env` (the captured environment, NULL for a non-capturing
 * closure) is ALWAYS the implicit first argument, ahead of the declared
 * parameters — exactly what codegen emits for `call(cb, ...)` and for
 * the `_closure_fn_N(env, ...)` definition.
 *
 * Ownership: the box (and the `env` it points at, when non-NULL) is
 * malloc'd by `_aether_box_closure` and OWNED BY THE CALLEE — the same
 * contract `list_add_closure_owned` / `list_free` use in
 * aether_collections.c. Each combinator below frees the env then the
 * box before returning, so a one-shot `string.seq_map(s, |x| ...)` does
 * not leak the closure.
 *
 * Complexity: every combinator is a single iterative spine walk —
 * O(n) time, O(1) auxiliary stack (no recursion). `map`/`filter`
 * build a fresh, independently-owned result spine (free with
 * `string_seq_free`); `each`/`zip_each` return nothing; `reduce`
 * returns the caller's accumulator.
 */

/* Apply `f(elem)` to each element, head-to-tail, for side effects.
