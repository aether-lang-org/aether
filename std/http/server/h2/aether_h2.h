/* aether_h2.h — HTTP/2 server-side glue (#260 Tier 2).
 *
 * Wraps libnghttp2 to give Aether's HTTP server an h2 + h2c data path.
 * The wrapper is fully encapsulated: callers feed bytes via
 * aether_h2_session_feed() and pull bytes to write via
 * aether_h2_session_pending(); nghttp2 handles framing, HPACK,
 * stream state, flow control, and SETTINGS negotiation.
 *
 * Trust + lifetime model:
 *   - One nghttp2_session per connection. Created at handshake/upgrade,
 *     destroyed when the connection closes.
 *   - Per-stream HttpRequest / HttpServerResponse pairs are constructed
 *     when nghttp2 reports END_STREAM on the request HEADERS, dispatched
 *     into the existing route table, and torn down when the response
 *     finishes writing.
 *   - The dispatch path runs synchronously on the connection's worker
 *     thread (matching the existing HTTP/1.1 path) — no per-stream
 *     actor children in v1; multiplexing is sequential per connection.
 *     Future work can spawn per-stream actors for concurrent dispatch.
 *
 * When the build doesn't link libnghttp2 the wrapper compiles to no-op
 * stubs; the only call site is server_handle_h2_connection which is
 * gated behind conn->is_h2, set only when ALPN selects "h2" (which
 * itself only happens when http_server_set_h2_raw was called).

 *
 * Returns the new session on success, NULL on any failure (caller
 * falls back to HTTP/1.1 with a 400 / closes the connection).
