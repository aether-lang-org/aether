/* std.worker — see aether_worker.h.
 *
 * A job is: run `work` on its own OS thread; on return, hand the job either to
 * the host's installed poster (which marshals it to the loop thread and calls
 * aether_worker_deliver there) or, if no poster is installed, onto a
 * mutex-guarded ready-list that aether_worker_drain() pops on the caller's
 * thread. Either way `done(result)` runs on a thread the CALLER controls, never
 * on the worker — that is the whole point.
 *
 * Closure envs are NOT freed here: per the closure-lifetime rules a captured
 * env is a bounded per-closure leak by design (retain-on-capture never
 * releases), the fail-safe direction (leak >> use-after-free). We own and free
 * only the WorkerJob wrapper. The `void*` result is likewise owned by the
 * `done` closure — we never touch it. */
