/* std.worker — off-thread worker + completion-on-the-loop-thread.
 *
 * The primitive every GUI toolkit has (Qt QThread+signal, GTK g_thread +
 * g_idle_add, Swing SwingWorker): run a closure on a background thread; when it
 * returns, deliver its result to a completion closure back on the thread that
 * owns the app's event loop, so the completion may safely touch UI / shared
 * state without a data race.
 *
 * This layer is toolkit-agnostic. It knows how to run work off-thread and how
 * to hold the completion until someone delivers it; it does NOT know how to get
 * onto "the main thread" — that is the host's job (aether-ui installs a poster
 * wrapping g_idle_add / dispatch_async / PostMessage). With no poster installed,
 * completed jobs queue on a pollable ready-list and aether_worker_drain() runs
 * them on the calling thread — the deterministic, toolkit-free path used by
 * headless apps and tests.
 *
 * Closures cross the FFI boundary as the compiler's `_AeClosure`
 * ({ fn, env }) by value; the env survives the hand-off because an extern
 * callee is treated as escaping (see the closure_extern_retains_no_uaf
 * regression). We invoke them with the emitted calling convention
 * fn(env, args...). */
