#ifndef CONTRACT_EVAL_H

/* Compile-time contract predicate evaluation (see docs/contract-folding.md).
 *
 * One evaluator, two consumers:
 *
 *   - The TYPECHECKER diagnoses: a predicate that is decidably FALSE — at a
 *     function definition, or at a call site with the actual arguments
 *     substituted for the parameters — is a compile error. `divide(10, 0)`
 *     against `b: int where b != 0` fails the build instead of panicking at
 *     run time.
 *   - CODEGEN elides: a predicate that is decidably TRUE at the definition
 *     emits no runtime check (this replaced codegen's older, double-based
 *     `try_fold_predicate`, whose 2^53 precision loss could mis-fold exact
 *     int64 comparisons).
 *
 * The evaluator is deliberately narrow, and two of its refusals are POLICY,
 * not laziness:
 *
 *   - It never evaluates CALLS — not even the pure-conversion whitelist that
 *     const initializers accept. The const layer is whitelist-only precisely
 *     so compile-time evaluation can't synthesize std.fs / std.net calls past
 *     the --emit=lib capability gate (see the block comment above
 *     is_const_expression in typechecker.c). Contract folding inherits that
 *     boundary.
 *   - Integer arithmetic is int64, not double. A diagnostic that mis-folds
 *     `x == 9007199254740993` because both sides rounded to 2^53 would error
 *     on correct code, which is the one way this feature can fail badly.
 *
 * Everything outside the supported subset is CONTRACT_UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN
 * always means "keep the runtime check, say nothing".
