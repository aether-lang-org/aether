# Third-party licenses

Portions of Aether's standard library and contrib modules are ported from
third-party open-source projects. Each ported source file carries an
attribution header naming its upstream; this file reproduces the upstream
licence texts in full. Where a module is original to Aether it is *not* listed
here.

## Bouncy Castle (bc-csharp) — MIT License

Used by the cryptography port (issue
[#739](https://github.com/aether-lang-org/aether/issues/739)). Files that port
logic, structure, or test vectors from Bouncy Castle for .NET carry the

Ported so far:

- `std/bits/` (`std.bits`) — bit helpers ported from `crypto/src/util/Integers.cs`
  and `crypto/src/util/Longs.cs` (rotate / leading-zeros / popcount).
- `std/bytes/` big-endian accessors (`set_be16/32/64`, `get_be16/32/64`) —
  modelled on `crypto/src/crypto/util/Pack.cs`.
- `tests/regression/test_bits.ae`, `test_bytes_be.ae` — test vectors ported
  from `crypto/test/src/util/utiltest/{IntegersTest,LongsTest}.cs`.
