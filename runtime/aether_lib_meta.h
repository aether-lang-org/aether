/* aether_lib_meta.h — symbol-catalog metadata for `--emit=lib`
 * artifacts (issue #403, MVP).
 *
 * Aether compiles to C, which inherits a flat-symbol-table linker
 * model — once a `.ae` is compiled to a `.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`, the
 * Aether-side namespace, parameter-naming, and source-location
 * info that the source carried is gone from the consumer's
 * perspective. This header defines a small in-binary surface that
 * preserves it: every `--emit=lib` artifact exports a
 * `aether_lib_meta()` function returning a pointer to a static
 * `AetherLibMeta` struct describing the artifact's exports.
 *
 * The format is plain C structs of `const char*` and `int`. No
 * dynamic allocation, no parsing. Any FFI consumer (Python ctypes,
 * Java Panama, Ruby Fiddle, Node-API, hand-rolled `dlsym`) can
 * walk the struct directly. The CLI tool `ae lib-info <path>`
 * dlopens an artifact, calls `aether_lib_meta()`, and prints the
 * catalog in human-readable form.
 *
 * v2 (schema "1.1") fills the `closure_count` / `closures` slots the
 * v1 layout reserved: one `AetherLibClosure` record per closure
 * surface reachable from an exported function — builder/trailing-block
 * DSL entry points, closure-typed parameters, and capturing closure
 * literals in an export's body, each with its rendered signature and
 * captured-variable list. This is what lets a *downstream Aether*
 * consumer reconstruct a closure-with-context builder DSL at full
 * fidelity instead of seeing the flattened C ABI. See
 * docs/emit-lib.md → "Two kinds of consumer".
 *
 * v3 (schema "1.2") fills the `constant_count` / `constants` slots:
 * one `AetherLibConstant` record per exported module-level `const`
 * declaration (scalar/string consts — `int`, `long`, `bool`, `float`,
 * `string`), so a downstream Aether consumer's `foo.SOME_CONST`
 * resolves against a `.so` exactly as it does against source. Typed
 * const *arrays* are out of scope (the emitter skips them rather than
 * emit a half-record). See emit-lib-export-constants-ask.md.
 *
 * Schema versioning: `schema_version` is "1.0" for function-only
 * artifacts, "1.1" once closure records are present, and "1.2" once
 * constant records are present. Hosts that read the metadata should
 * accept any "1.<minor>" — within "1.x" fields are only ever appended,
 * and a reader that predates a field stops at the count/pointer it
 * knows (a "1.0" reader ignores `closures` and `constants` exactly as
 * before; the slots were always there). The "all-zero / NULL means
 * absent" contract holds for every appended field.
