# `std.snapshot` — Copy-on-Write Snapshot Cell

A **copy-on-write snapshot cell** for read-mostly shared data: configuration,
routing tables, feature flags — anything read on nearly every request but
rebuilt only rarely.

> **Reads are lock-free.** A read is a single atomic acquire load of a
> pointer. Readers never block, never spin, never coordinate.

Import with:

```aether
import std.snapshot
```

Issue [#840](https://github.com/aether-lang/aether/issues/840).

## The idea

The cell holds **one atomic pointer** to an immutable value (the "snapshot").
Many actors read the current snapshot concurrently. A single writer
occasionally builds a brand-new snapshot and publishes it by swapping the
pointer. Because a read is just an acquire load of that pointer, readers touch
no shared lock and contend nothing but the pointer's cache line — and only when
it actually changes.

This is the read-mostly answer. It is the structure behind Go's
`atomic.Pointer`, Linux's RCU, and Java's `CopyOnWriteArrayList`. Aether
differs from all three in one decisive way: **Aether has no garbage collector**,
so reclaiming the displaced snapshot is the caller's job and must be done with
care. See [Reclamation contract](#reclamation-contract-read-this) — it is the
whole point of this page.

## API

| Call | Signature | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `snapshot.new` | `(initial: ptr) -> ptr` | Allocate a cell pointing at `initial` (may be `null`). Returns the cell, or `null` on alloc failure / memory-cap exceeded. Does **not** take ownership of `initial`. |
| `snapshot.load` | `(cell: ptr) -> ptr` | **Lock-free** read: atomic acquire load of the current snapshot. `null` cell → `null`. |
| `snapshot.store` | `(cell: ptr, new_value: ptr) -> ptr` | Atomically publish `new_value` (release exchange) and **return the displaced (old) snapshot** for the writer to reclaim. `null` cell → `null`. |
| `snapshot.cas` | `(cell: ptr, expected: ptr, new_value: ptr) -> int` | Compare-and-swap. If the cell holds `expected`, swap in `new_value` and return `1`; else return `0` and leave it unchanged. `null` cell → `0`. |
| `snapshot.free` | `(cell: ptr)` | Free the **cell itself**. Does **not** free the snapshot it points at. `null`-safe. |

The cell struct is allocated through `aether_caps_malloc` and freed through
`aether_caps_free`, so it participates in the process-wide memory cap
(`--emit=lib` resource caps). The snapshot **values** are caller-owned and
accounted by whoever allocates them.

### Memory ordering

`load` is an **acquire** load; `store`/`cas` publish with **release**. This
pairing is mandatory, not a tuning knob: it guarantees that a reader which
observes a freshly-published pointer also observes every write the writer made
while building that snapshot. Relaxed ordering would let a reader see the new
pointer but a stale, half-built value — a real data race.

---

## Reclamation contract (read this)

**The cell never owns or frees the snapshot values.** It stores only the
pointer. `store` and `cas` succeed by swapping the pointer and **returning the
displaced (old) snapshot** so the **writer** can reclaim it.

But here is the trap. The displaced snapshot may still be in use by an
in-flight reader that called `load` microseconds before the swap:

```
reader:  p = load(cell)          // got snapshot N
writer:                  store(cell, N+1) -> returns N
reader:  ...still reading p (N)...
writer:  free(N)                 // USE-AFTER-FREE — reader still holds N
```

So the writer must **defer** the free until a **grace period** has elapsed —
an interval during which every reader that could be holding the old pointer has
finished its read. This is exactly the RCU `synchronize` / `call_rcu`
discipline. It is **not** a workaround; it is the correct, standard approach for
reclaiming lock-free-read data in a language without a garbage collector.

> **Auto-freeing the displaced snapshot inside `store` would be a
> use-after-free.** `std.snapshot` deliberately does not do it. Returning the
> old pointer and making reclamation explicit is the honest design.

### The actor-writer pattern (defer one generation)

In Aether's actor model the grace period falls out naturally. Route all writes
through a single **writer-actor**. Readers are other actors that `load` and
finish handling one message before processing the next. Because an actor reads
the snapshot, uses it, and returns — all within one message handler — a reader
cannot hold a pointer across two of the writer's publishes. So the writer can
safely **defer one generation**: when it publishes snapshot N+1, it frees
snapshot N−1.

```aether
import std.snapshot

// Writer-actor: owns the cell plus the one deferred (previous) snapshot.
// `cell` holds the live snapshot; `prev` is snapshot N-1, awaiting its
// grace period.
actor ConfigWriter {
    state cell = null    // set to snapshot.new(initial) at startup
    state prev = null    // snapshot N-1, awaiting its grace period

    receive {
        // `next` is the freshly-built snapshot N+1.
        Publish(next) -> {
            // Publish N+1. `displaced` is snapshot N.
            displaced = snapshot.store(cell, next)

            // By now every reader that could hold N-1 (`prev`) has long
            // since finished — each processed at least one message
            // between the publish of N-1 and now. Reclaim it.
            if prev != null {
                free_config(prev)
            }

            // Defer the just-displaced snapshot one more generation.
            prev = displaced
        }
    }
}
```

Tune the deferral depth to your reader latency: if a reader might hold a pointer
across *k* publishes, defer *k* generations (a small ring of pending frees). One
generation is enough whenever a read completes within a single message handler,
which is the common case.

### The CAS loop (read-modify-write)

Use `cas` when the new snapshot is derived from the current one and concurrent
writers are possible (or just for a uniform pattern):

```aether
loop {
    cur  = snapshot.load(cell)
    next = build_next_from(cur)        // pure; allocates `next`
    if snapshot.cas(cell, cur, next) == 1 {
        // Won. `cur` is now displaced — reclaim it after a grace
        // period (defer it), NOT immediately.
        defer_reclaim(cur)
        break
    }
    // Lost the race: another writer published first. Free our unused
    // candidate and retry against the new current value.
    free_value(next)
}
```

On **success** the caller owns the displaced `cur` (reclaim after a grace
period). On **failure** nothing was published, so the caller still owns `next`
and frees it before retrying.

## When to use it — and when not to

**Use `std.snapshot` for read-mostly data:**

- Configuration reloaded on SIGHUP or a control-plane push.
- Routing / dispatch tables rebuilt when topology changes.
- Feature-flag sets refreshed every few seconds.
- Any value where reads vastly outnumber writes and each write rebuilds the
  whole value.

**Do not use it for:**

- **Write-heavy data.** Every publish rebuilds the entire value, so a write
  costs O(value size). If writes are frequent, that copy cost dominates.
- **Large values that change often.** Same reason — the per-write rebuild is
  the cost you are trading reads against.
- **Fine-grained mutation.** This cell swaps a whole value atomically; it is not
  a concurrent map with per-key updates. For a write-heavy, well-spread key
  space, use the [sharded actor map](sharded-actor-map.md) instead — it
  partitions per-key writes across `N` owner actors.

### Why not `RWMutex`?

A read/write mutex is the trap this primitive replaces. A read lock still writes
a shared cache line on every acquire/release, so readers contend with each other
even though they only read; under heavy read load that line ping-pongs across
cores. And a write lock starves readers for the duration of the rebuild. The COW
cell's read path touches nothing shared but the snapshot pointer, and only when
it actually changes — so N readers cost nothing extra beyond N pointer loads,
and a publish never blocks a reader. For read-mostly data the COW cell is the
better answer.
