# Strategy A for Java: install default-jdk-headless, build the
# aether-sandbox.jar that contrib.host.java needs, capture it,
# purge the JDK. Layer cost: ~50 KB (the JAR) instead of ~250 MB.
#
# Unlike the in-process C-bridge hosts (python/lua/perl/ruby/js),
# contrib.host.java spawns `java` as a subprocess from end-user
# programs. So:
#   - BUILD-TIME (here): javac + jar to produce aether-sandbox.jar
#   - END-USER RUN-TIME (their target host): needs `java` on PATH
#
# We capture the JAR so the toolchain image can ship it via the
# contrib install layout, but the JDK/JRE themselves don't ride
# along. Documented in the image's README — end-user binaries that
# import contrib.host.java need a JRE installed wherever they're
# deployed.

# javac defaults to the platform's default-charset; bookworm-slim has
# no UTF-8 locale installed, so source files with UTF-8 content
# (em-dashes etc.) fail. Force UTF-8 explicitly via the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
# env var — picked up by javac without needing a generated locale.
