# Clone the hosted-language-headers repo at a pinned commit. The
# per-language WITH_<LANG> scripts then just copy from
# /opt/hosted-language-headers/<lang>/ into /opt/aether/include/<lang>/.
# This replaces the apt-install-dev / capture / apt-purge dance with
# a single network fetch + flat copies.
#
# Why pinned: reproducible builds. If hosted-language-headers gets
# new headers for a different language version (Python 3.12, say),
# image builds keep using the version we tested against until the
# pin is bumped explicitly.
#
# Why git rather than a tarball: cheap branching for non-x86_64 /
# non-glibc targets later. Today main = linux-x86_64-glibc; a
# linux-arm64-glibc branch would land later without a release-
# artefact dance.

# Full clone, then check out the pinned commit. A `--depth 1` clone

# supports it, but a real Bazzite report (2026-05-30) showed it
# failing with `fatal: reference is not a tree: <sha>`. A full clone
# of hosted-language-headers is ~14 MB and the .git dir is dropped
# below — small price for deterministic image builds.
